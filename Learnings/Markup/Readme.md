# 📝 Markup — Things I Learned

This repo is my personal space to note down **anything new or interesting I learn** — commands, concepts, mistakes, or random curiosities.  
No fixed schedule, no rules. Just growth, one note at a time.

### 📂 How It Works
- Each file = one new thing I learned.  
- File name format: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`  
- Example:  
2025-10-06-linux-permissions.md
2025-10-09-tcp-handshake.md

### ✍️ Mini Template (for new notes)

Just one or two lines about why it matters or how I might use it later.

### 💬 Example
Understanding chmod
Date: 2025-10-06

💡 What I Learned
chmod 755 file gives the owner full access and others read + execute permissions.

🧠 Why It's Cool
Now I understand why scripts sometimes fail — it's all about the execute bit.

### 🚀 Goal
Keep learning.
Keep writing.
Don't let small wins disappear.
