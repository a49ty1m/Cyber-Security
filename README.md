# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Learning Journey (Pentest/Red Team Track)

Welcome to my **cybersecurity progress repo** — a living record of my journey into penetration testing and red-teaming.  
Here I’ll post **writeups, scripts, labs, and notes** as I progress through my 12-month roadmap.

---

## 📌 Goals
- Become proficient in penetration testing & red-team methodologies
- Build hands-on skills with Linux, networking, web exploitation, AD attacks
- Prepare for certifications like **eJPT** and **OSCP**
- Maintain professional writeups and automation scripts to showcase on my resume

---

## 📅 Current Plan
- **Duration:** Oct 2025 – Oct 2026  
- **Weekly Commitment:** ~30 hrs/week (study + labs + writeups)  
- **Learning Style:** Mixed (theory + hands-on labs + writeups)  

| Month | Focus | Milestone |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Linux + Networking + Lab Setup | Kali & Windows VM setup, 10 TryHackMe rooms |
| 2 | Recon & Scanning | 20 nmap scans, automation script |
| 3 | Web Fundamentals | DVWA & Juice Shop writeups, Burp basics |
| 4 | Exploitation | Own 5 vulnerable VMs, prep for eJPT |
| 5+ | AD, Exploit Dev, Capstone | Ongoing... |
