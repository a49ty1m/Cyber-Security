# CTF Writeups

This directory contains writeups for Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and competitions.

## Structure

Organize writeups by platform or competition:
```
ctf-writeups/
├── tryhackme/
├── hackthebox/
├── picoctf/
└── [competition-name]/
```

## Writeup Template

For each challenge, include:
1. **Challenge Name** - Title and category
2. **Difficulty** - Easy/Medium/Hard
3. **Description** - Brief overview of the challenge
4. **Solution** - Step-by-step explanation
5. **Tools Used** - List of tools and techniques
6. **Lessons Learned** - Key takeaways

## Guidelines

- Only publish writeups for challenges that allow public sharing
- Respect platform rules and embargo periods
- Focus on explaining methodology, not just answers
- Include screenshots where helpful
