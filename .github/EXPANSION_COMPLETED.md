## Next Steps (Optional Future Work)

1. **Further Expansion** (~100-150 more items):
   - Parts 7, 9-15, 17-26, 28 need 10-20 additional items each
   - Completeness target: 35-40%

2. **Standardization**:
   - Add goal statements to all remaining Parts (2-7, 9-30)
   - Rename overlapping Phase/Stage/Layer terminology

3. **Cross-Linking**:
   - Add references between related parts
   - Link MITRE ATT&CK mappings to specific techniques

4. **Validation**:
   - Industry alignment check (CEH, OSCP, GPEN)
   - Practitioner review of practical applicability
